The sky burned with a deep red glow as the sun dipped behind the red horizon.
A red scarf fluttered in the wind, catching the reflection of the red lanterns that lined the narrow street.
Red roses climbed the old brick walls, their petals scattered across the red stone path.
Even the quiet river seemed tinted with red, carrying the warmth of the evening light.
